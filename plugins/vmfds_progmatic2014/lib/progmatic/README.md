=================

A PHP api to read and write .dat files from the ProgMatic 2014 software

This set of scripts permits to read and write .dat files for the the ProgMatic 
2014 software by EuroTronic (http://www.eurotronic.org/produkte/progmatic-2014/software-progmatic-2014.html).

The files produced by these scripts can be read into the ProgMatic 2014 software
and used to program a ProgMatic 2014 stick, which can then in turn transfer its
programming to different thermostats.

PLEASE NOTE:
------------

(1) This software is provided AS IS and WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.
(2) This software is based on an INCOMPLETE implementation of the underlying .dat format. It might or might not work for your scenario. Use at your own risk!
(3) This software and its authors are in no way related to EuroTronic, nor can EuroTronic be held liable for the effects, results or damages caused by the use of these scripts.
